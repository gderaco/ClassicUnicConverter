# ClassicUnicConverter
This is the first universal app I made for WinRT (8.1 and Phone 8.1)

This app uses [UnitsNet](https://github.com/InitialForce/UnitsNet) and a LOT of Reflection.

You can download it from the [Windows Store](http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/it-it/app/96dfa63e-0e15-4385-9e39-9c9e6e7f7ea8) (only the 8.1 version)
